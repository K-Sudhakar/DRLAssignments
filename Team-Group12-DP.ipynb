    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Design and implement a reinforcement learning agent using dynamic programming (value iteration or policy iteration) to compute an optimal policy for a simplified chess game. The agent plays as White and must learn how to convert an advantage into a win or at least avoid a loss in a MiniChess game against a defensive opponent. The problem must be modelled as a finite MDP. Register number of first student in a group (alphabetically sorted) will be considered for configuration design.\n",
    "The student will:\n",
    "* Implement a custom Mini Chess environment.\n",
    "* Use dynamic programming to compute the optimal value function and policy.\n",
    "* Analyze how state design and reward shaping affect the learned policy and convergence."

    "### Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You are building a “Mini Chess Game” for beginner players. The coach focuses on a small, tractable game:\n",
    "* White: King + Pawn\n",
    "* Black: King\n",
    "* Board: 4×4 or 5×5 MiniChess board\n",
    "* White moves first and tries to either:\n",
    "    * Promote the pawn and then deliver checkmate, or\n",
    "    * Force a checkmate directly (if possible)\n",
    "\n",
    "Black tries to prevent this by blocking the pawn, chasing the white king, or capturing the pawn. The game is restricted to this small set of pieces and a tiny board."

    "### Environment Description\n",
    "#### Board and Pieces\n",
    "* Board size:\n",
    "    * If the student roll number / registration number is even: use a 4×4 board (rows 0–3, cols 0–3).\n",
    "    * If odd: use a 5×5 board (rows 0–4, cols 0–4).\n",
    "* Pieces always present:\n",
    "    * White King (WK)\n",
    "    * White Pawn (WP)\n",
    "    * Black King (BK)\n",
    "    * No castling, no en passant, no promotion to anything other than Queen.\n",
    "* Legal Moves\n",
    "    * Kings move like normal chess kings - one square in any direction (8- neighborhood), staying on the board.\n",
    "    * Pawn:\n",
    "        * Moves one square forward (towards larger row index or smaller row index – the student must choose and clearly document a convention).\n",
    "        * Captures diagonally forward by one square.\n",
    "    * All usual constraints apply:\n",
    "        * Kings cannot move into check.\n",
    "        * Two kings may never occupy adjacent squares (illegal state).\n",
    "        * A piece cannot move through other pieces.\n",
    "* Episode Termination\n",
    "    * An episode ends when any of the following happens:\n",
    "        * Checkmate (White checkmates Black).\n",
    "        * Stalemate (side to move has no legal moves but is not in check).\n",
    "        * Pawn Capture (Black captures the White pawn).\n",
    "        * Pawn Promotion (White pawn reaches last rank and becomes a Queen). After promotion, they may either:\n",
    "                * (a) terminate immediately with a reward, or\n",
    "                * (b) continue playing with a Queen replacing the pawn.\n",
    "        * The student must choose one approach and justify it.\n",
    "        * Move limit exceeded (e.g., 20 or 30 plies) – draw\n",
    "1. State Space\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each state should minimally encode:\n",
    "    * Coordinates of WK: (r_wk, c_wk)\n",
    "    * Coordinates of WP (or a special value if promoted/captured): (r_wp, c_wp) or status flag\n",
    "    * Coordinates of BK: (r_bk, c_bk)\n",
    "    * Player to move: {White, Black}\n",
    "    * Any additional flags that can be necessary like,\n",
    "        * Has the pawn promoted?\n",
    "        * Check / checkmate / stalemate indicators.\n",
    "* The student must:\n",
    "    * Describe the state representation clearly.\n",
    "2. Action Space\n",
    "    * For each state, actions are the legal moves for the side to move:\n",
    "        * Move King to a legal square\n",
    "        * Move Pawn / promoted Queen\n",
    "    * The student must implement a function that, given a state, returns all legal actions.\n",
    "3. Rewards\n",
    "* The student has to define the reward schemes like:\n",
    "    * White checkmates Black: +10\n",
    "    * Pawn gets captured: -10\n",
    "    * Stalemate or draw by move limit: 0\n",
    "    * All non-terminal moves: 0"

    "# Design Choices and Justifications\n",
    "\n",
    "## State Representation\n",
    "- **Pawn Promotion Handling:** We implement **Approach (a)** - immediate termination at promotion\n",
    "  - **Rationale:** Simplifies the state space by avoiding Queen movement complexity\n",
    "  - **Alternative:** Approach (b) would require implementing full Queen movement and new checkmate detection logic, which significantly expands the state space\n",
    "  - **Impact:** The agent learns to prioritize pawn promotion as a winning strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checkmate vs.  Stalemate\n",
    "- **Checkmate:** King is in check AND has no legal moves → **White wins (+10)**\n",
    "- **Stalemate:** King is NOT in check but has no legal moves → **Draw (0)**\n",
    "- **Implementation:** Separate methods `is_checkmate()` and `is_stalemate()` provide clear distinction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Move Limit (max_plies)\n",
    "- Episodes terminate after `max_plies` moves with reward 0 (draw)\n",
    "- Default:  30 moves (60 half-moves in standard chess notation)\n",
    "- Prevents infinite loops in learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reward Shaping\n",
    "- Immediate rewards:  +10 (White wins), -10 (White loses), 0 (draw/ongoing)\n",
    "- Sparse reward design encourages multi-step planning\n",
    "- No intermediate rewards encourage efficient solutions"
